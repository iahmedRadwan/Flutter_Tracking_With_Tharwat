/// The Question is
/// What does it mean for Dart to be a statically-typed language, and how does it impact the way variables are used?
///
// And Answer is
// Variables are statically created at compilation time
// this mean that enfource you to but a value of type only when write code not need to wait untill run code to tell you this error
// for example if you define a variable from type String and assign value of type int it get error in ide in compile time not need to runtime to tell you about error
