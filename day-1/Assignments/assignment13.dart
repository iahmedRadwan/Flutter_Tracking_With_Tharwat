/// The Question is
/// What will be the output of this code snippet? Explain your answer: ```dart void main() { int x = 5; int y = x + 2 * 3; print(y); } ```
///
// And Answer is
// the output is 11
// Explination is x = 5 then in y multiplication have higher order than addition so 2 * 3 = 6 then 6 + 5 = 11
