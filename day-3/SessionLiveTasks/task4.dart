// Exercise 4: Iterating with a for-in Loop
// Objective: Understand the for-in loop for iterating through collections.
// Task: Write a program that defines a list of integers and prints each number using a for-in loop.

void main() {
  List<int> integarNumber = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8];
  for (var number in integarNumber) {
    print(number);
  }
}
